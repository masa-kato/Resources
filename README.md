## Machine Learning / Deep Learning Coursework
* [Coursera - Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)  
One of the best introductions to machine learning taught by Andrew Ng, a pioneer in machine learning and cofounder of coursera. A bit of trivia - coursera was initially created as a platform to offer this course, which was originally a University course taught at Stanford (CS 229). In the course, Andrew touches upon a variety of machine learning algorithms at a high-level. Only very basic math & coding knowledge is required to complete the coursework. The coding assignments are done in Octave/Matlab.

* [Coursera - Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)    
A five course specialization focused on learning the fundamentals of deep learning taught by Andrew Ng. Covers implementation of deep learning algorithms from scratch in Python as well as in TensorFlow. Some of the material include CNNs, RNNs, LSTM, various gradient descent algorithms, drop-out, etc. Only basic math knowledge is necessary. If you do not want to pay for the specialization, each individual course can be audited for free. Should you choose this path, your assignments will not be graded but you may still submit coding assignments to see if your code was correct.  

* [Stanford CS229 - Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/)  
[2008 Lecture Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599)  
The university course version of the simplified machine learning course offered in coursera. The course is deeply rooted in theory & Andrew explains the concepts/algorithms from a much more mathematical perspective. If you thought the coursera material was too easy, try this course instead. As such, the prerequisites include adequacy in Calculus, Linear Algebra, Programming, & Statistics.

* [Stanford CS231n - Convolutional Neural Network for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)   
[Spring 2017 Lecture Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv)  
[Winter 2016 Lecture Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC)  
If you want a comprehensive introduction to deep learning for computer vision, look no further. Fei Fei Li, Justin Johnson, & Andrej Karpathy do a phenomenal job at explaining the intuition behind each algorithm in great depth. Amongst the material covered are CNN (Various Architectures), Semantic Segmentation , RNN, LSTM, & deployment of the mentioned algorithms in AWS / Google Cloud. Prerequisites for this class include proficiency in Python, Calculus, Linear Algebra, & Statistics/Probability. The main difference between the 2017 course from the 2016 course is the addition of a couple new topics: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Deep Reinforcement Learning, & Transfer Learning.

* [Stanford CS224n - Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)  
[Winter 2017 Lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6)  
Natural Language Processing is one of the most important technologies of the world today. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate most everything in language: web search, advertisement, emails, language translation, etc. This course covers a variety of topics including: word vector representations, window-based neural networks, RNN, LSTM models, recursive neural networks, CNNs as well as some recent models involving a memory component. Proficiency in Python, Calculus, Linear Algebra, & Statistics/Probability is required for this course.

* [MIT 6.S094 - Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/)  
A series of six lectures by Lex Fridman who gives an introduction to the practice of deep learning through the applied theme of building a self-driving car. No prior experience with machine learning is necessary for this course.


* [Fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)  
[Part I](http://course.fast.ai/)  
[Part II](http://course.fast.ai/part2.html)  
[Computational Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtmWHNX-gukIc92m1K0P6bIOnZb-mg0hY)  
Instructors Jeremy Howard & Rachel Thomas created fast.ai as a more practical approach to deep learning. Opposed to the conventional university setting, fast.ai takes a top-down approach where you learn the implementation of an algorithm before learning about all the nitty gritty details.
Part I covers CNN, RNN, & NLP topics & implementation via PyTorch in AWS. Part II deals with more cutting edge deep learning models & consist of implementing new academic papers. These include: Artistic Style Transfer, GANs, Memory Networks, Attention Models, & Neural Translation.
The course is completely free apart from the rates that may result from using the GPU instances on AWS.

* [UCL COMPM050 - Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0)  
A series of lectures given by David Silver on Reinforcement Learning. David Silver leads the RL research group at DeepMind & was one of the lead researchers in the development of AlphaGo.
